            number of locations defined in config.Parasite_Genetics.Barcode_Genome_Locations. Each character of the

        drug_resistant_string: Used with 'BARCODE_STRING' or 'NUCLEOTIDE_SEQUENCE'. A series of nucleotide base
            letters (A, C, G, T) that represent the values at locations in the genome. The length of the string depends
            on the number of locations defined in config.Parasite_Genetics.Drug_Resistant_Genome_Locations. Each

            less than or equal to it.
        pfemp1_variants_values: Used with 'NUCLEOTIDE_SEQUENCE'. The PfEMP1 Variant values / major epitopes used to
            define how the antibodies recognize the infected red blood cells. The values of the array depend on
            config. Falciparum_PfEMP1_Variants and must be less than or equal to it.
            There must be exactly 50 values – one for each epitope.
        barcode_allele_frequencies_per_genome_location: Used with 'ALLELE_FREQUENCIES'. The fractions of allele
            occurrences for each location in the barcode. This 2D array should have one array for each
            location/character in the barcode. For each location, there should be four values between 0 and 1
            indicating the probability that specific character appears. The possible letters are: A=0, C=1, G=2, T=3.
            The frequencies should sum up to 1.
        drug_resistant_allele_frequencies_per_genome_location:Used with 'ALLELE_FREQUENCIES'. The fractions of allele
            occurrences for each location in the drug resistant markers. This 2D array should have one array for each
            drug resistant location. For each location, there should be four values between 0 and 1 indicating the
            probability that specific character will appear. The possible letters are S'A'=0, 'C'=1, 'G'=2, 'T'=3.
            The frequencies should sum up to 1.
        hrp_allele_frequencies_per_genome_location: Used with 'ALLELE_FREQUENCIES'. The fractions of allele occurrences
            for each location in the HRP markers.  This 2D array should have one array for each HRP location.
            For each location, there should be four values between 0 and 1 indicating the probability that specific
            character will appear. The possible letters are 'A'=0, 'C'=1, 'G'=2, 'T'=3.
        hrp_string: Used with 'BARCODE_STRING' or 'NUCLEOTIDE_SEQUENCE'. A series of nucleotide base letters (A, C, G, T)
            that represent the HRP values at locations in the genome. There must be one character for each location
            defined in <config>.Parasite_Genetics.HRP_Genome_Locations. 'A' means HRP marker is present and a
            non-'A' means it isn't.

            becoming infectious. This value overrides the incubation period set in the configuration file.
