    Args:
        campaign: campaign object to which the intervention will be added, and schema_path container
        start_day: The day on which to start distributing the bednets
            (**Start_Day** parameter).
        demographic_coverage: This value is the probability that each individual in the target population will
            receive the intervention. It does not guarantee that the exact fraction of the target population set by
            Demographic_Coverage receives the intervention.
        target_num_individuals: The exact number of people to select out of the targeted group. If this value is set,
            demographic_coverage parameter is ignored
        node_ids: The list of nodes to apply this intervention to (**Node_List** parameter). If not provided,
            intervention is distributed to all nodes.
        ind_property_restrictions: A list of dictionaries of IndividualProperties, which are needed for the individual
            to receive the intervention. Sets the **Property_Restrictions_Within_Node**
        ind_property_restrictions: The IndividualProperty key:value pairs
            that individuals must have to receive the intervention (
            **Property_Restrictions_Within_Node** parameter). In the format ``[{
            "BitingRisk":"High"}, {"IsCool":"Yes}]``.
        intervention_name: The optional name used to refer to this intervention as a means to differentiate it from
            others that use the same class. Itâ€™s possible to have multiple UsageDependentBednets interventions
            attached to a person if they have different Intervention_Name values.
        discard_config: A dictionary of parameters needed to define expiration distribution.
            No need to definite the distribution with all its parameters
            Default is bednet being discarded with EXPONENTIAL_DISTRIBUTION with Expiration_Period_Exponential of 10 years

            Examples::

                    for Gaussian: {"Expiration_Period_Distribution": "GAUSSIAN_DISTRIBUTION",
                                   "Expiration_Period_Gaussian_Mean": 20,
                                   "Expiration_Period_Gaussian_Std_Dev":10}
                    for Exponential: {"Expiration_Period_Distribution": "EXPONENTIAL_DISTRIBUTION",
                                     "Expiration_Period_Exponential":150}

        insecticide: The name of the insecticide defined in <config.Insecticides> for this intervention.
            If insecticides are being used, then this must be defined as one of those values.  If they are not
            being used, then this does not needed to be specified or can be empty string.  It cannot have a
            value if <config.Insecticides> does not define anything.
        repelling_initial_effect: Initial strength of the Repelling effect. The effect may decay over time.
        repelling_box_duration: Box duration of effect in days before the decay of Repelling Initial_Effect.
        repelling_decay_time_constant: The exponential decay length, in days of the Repelling Initial_Effect.
        blocking_initial_effect: Initial strength of the Blocking effect. The effect may decay over time.
        blocking_box_duration: Box duration of effect in days before the decay of Blocking Initial_Effect.
        blocking_decay_time_constant: The exponential decay length, in days of the Blocking Initial_Effect.
        blocking_linear_times: An array of days that matches the defined linear values for Blocking Initial_Effect
        blocking_linear_values: An array of multiplier values that matches the defined linear days for
            Blocking Initial_Effect.
        blocking_expire_at_end: Set to 1 to have efficacy go to zero and let the intervention expire when the end of
            the map is reached.  Only vaccines and bednet usage currently support this expiration feature.
            defaults to 0.
        killing_initial_effect: Initial strength of the Killing effect. The effect may decay over time.
        killing_box_duration: Box duration of effect in days before the decay of Killing Initial_Effect.
        killing_decay_time_constant: The exponential decay length, in days of the Killing Initial_Effect.
        age_dependence: A dictionary defining the age dependence of net use.
            Must contain a list of ages in years and list of usage rate. Default
            is uniform across all ages.
            Times are in years of age
            Examples::

                {"Times":[], "Values":[]} or {"youth_cov":0.7, "youth_min_age":3, "youth_max_age":13}

        seasonal_dependence: A dictionary defining the seasonal dependence of net use. Time since start will
            reset to zero once it reaches 365. This allows you to simulate seasonal effects. Times are given in days
            of the year; values greater than 365 are ignored. Dictionaries can be (times, values) for linear spline
            or (minimum coverage, day of maximum coverage) for sinusoidal dynamics.
            Default is constant use during the year.
            Examples::

                {"Times":[], "Values":[]} or {"min_cov":0.45, "max_day":300}

            If insecticides are being used, then this must be defined as one of those values.  If they are not
            being used, then this does not needed to be specified or can be empty string.  It cannot have a
            value if <config.Insecticides> does not define anything.

        repelling_initial_effect: Initial strength of the Repelling effect. The effect may decay over time.
        repelling_box_duration: Box duration of effect in days before the decay of Repelling Initial_Effect.
        repelling_decay_time_constant: The exponential decay length, in days of the Repelling Initial_Effect.

        blocking_expire_at_end: Set to 1 to have efficacy go to zero and let the intervention expire when the end of
            the map is reached.  Only vaccines and bednet usage currently support this expiration feature.
            defaults to 0.
        killing_initial_effect: Initial strength of the Killing effect. The effect may decay over time.
        killing_box_duration: Box duration of effect in days before the decay of Killing Initial_Effect.

        seasonal_dependence: A dictionary defining the seasonal dependence of net use. Time since start will
            reset to zero once it reaches 365. This allows you to simulate seasonal effects. Times are given in days
            of the year; values greater than 365 are ignored. Dictionaries can be (times, values) for linear spline
            or (minimum coverage, day of maximum coverage) for sinusoidal dynamics.
            Default is constant use during the year.
            Examples::

                {"Times":[], "Values":[]} or {"min_cov":0.45, "max_day":300}



    Returns:
