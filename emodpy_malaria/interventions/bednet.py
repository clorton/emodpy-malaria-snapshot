        usage_decay_time_constant: ?
        insecticide:The name of the insecticide defined in config.Insecticides for this intervention.
            If insecticides are being used, then this must be defined as one of those values.  If they are not
            being used, then this does not needed to be specified or can be empty string.  It cannot have a
            value if config.Insecticides does not define anything.
        cost: Unit cost per bednet
        intervention_name: The optional name used to refer to this intervention as a means to differentiate it from
            others that use the same class. Itâ€™s possible to have multiple SimpleBednet interventions
            attached to a person if they have different Intervention_Name values.

    Returns:
        Nothing
